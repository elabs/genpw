# genpw

A super simple shell script for generating passwords.

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:elabs/genpw.git
    cd genpw
    sudo make install

## Usage

    genpw

Or for a readable password composed of dictionary words:

    genpw -r

It also copies the password to the clipboard for you (on OSX), yay!
